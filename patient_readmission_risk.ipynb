    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Design an AI system that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after being discharged. The goal is to identify at-risk patients early and reduce unnecessary readmissions, which strain healthcare resources and impact patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. Predict 30-day readmission risk for each discharged patient.\n",
    "2. Support early intervention by medical staff for high-risk cases.\n",
    "3. Reduce overall hospital readmission rates and improve patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "- **Hospital Administrators** – for cost and resource optimization.\n",
    "- **Doctors and Nurses** – to prioritize high-risk patients.\n",
    "- **Patients and Caregivers** – to receive better follow-up care.\n",
    "- **Health Insurance Providers** – to reduce avoidable claims.\n"

    "## 2. Data Strategy (10 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selected Dataset\n",
    "**Dataset:** Diabetes 130-US hospitals for readmission prediction  \n",
    "**Source:** [Kaggle – Brandão Diabetes Readmission Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brandao/diabetes)  \n",
    "This dataset includes over 100,000 hospital admissions for diabetes patients, with features spanning demographics, clinical data, treatments, and readmission status.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "1. **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)**  \n",
    "   - Diagnosis codes: `diag_1`, `diag_2`, `diag_3`  \n",
    "   - Lab tests: `num_lab_procedures`, `num_procedures`, `number_lab_procedures`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demographic Data**  \n",
    "   - `race`, `gender`, `age`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hospital Administrative Data**  \n",
    "   - Admission/discharge details: `admission_type_id`, `discharge_disposition_id`, `admission_source_id`  \n",
    "   - Hospital stay length: `time_in_hospital`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Medication & Treatment Records**  \n",
    "   - Medications and dosing: `metformin`, `repaglinide`, `insulin`, etc.  \n",
    "   - Treatment change indicator: `change`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Readmission Outcome**  \n",
    "   - `readmitted`: categories `<30`, `>30`, `NO`, which will be converted to a binary target (`<30` = 1, otherwise = 0)\n",

    "---\n",

    "### Ethical Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patient Privacy & Confidentiality**  \n",
    "   - Although the dataset is de-identified, risks remain (e.g. re-identification via combination with external data).  \n",
    "   - Must implement secure storage (encryption, access controls) and avoid sharing sensitive info.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Algorithmic Bias & Fairness**  \n",
    "   - Certain demographics (e.g., racial groups or age brackets) may be underrepresented.  \n",
    "   - If uncorrected, the model could underperform for minority groups, perpetuating disparities in post-discharge care.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Pipeline Design\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Data Cleaning**\n",
    "- Replace placeholder values like `?` with `NaN`.\n",
    "- Decide whether to drop or impute missing values based on data quality.\n",
    "- Remove duplicate rows.\n",
    "- Filter out non-applicable `discharge_disposition_id` values (e.g., transfers to hospice or death).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Feature Encoding**\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables (`race`, `gender`, `admission_type_id`, `discharge_disposition_id`, `medical_specialty`) via one-hot encoding or label encoding.\n",
    "- Standardize medication columns (`metformin`, etc.) to indicate whether the patient was on the medication (e.g., binary coding).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Target Encoding**\n",
    "- Convert `readmitted` to binary:\n",
    "  - `<30` → 1 (readmitted within 30 days)  \n",
    "  - `NO` or `>30` → 0 (not readmitted within 30 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Normalization/Scaling**\n",
    "- Apply `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` to numerical fields (`time_in_hospital`, `num_lab_procedures`, `number_inpatient`, etc.) to improve model convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Feature Engineering**\n",
    "- **`has_prior_readmission`**: flag as 1 if `number_inpatient` > 0, else 0.\n",
    "- **`medication_change_flag`**: 1 if `change` == ‘Ch’, else 0.\n",
    "- **Age binning**: convert `age` intervals (e.g., `[0–10)`, `[10–20)`, etc.) to numeric ordinal codes for easier modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Class Imbalance Handling**\n",
    "- If the `<30 days` class is underrepresented, apply SMOTE or perform undersampling of the majority class to balance the dataset.\n",
