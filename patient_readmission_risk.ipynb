    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Design an AI system that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after being discharged. The goal is to identify at-risk patients early and reduce unnecessary readmissions, which strain healthcare resources and impact patient outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "1. Predict 30-day readmission risk for each discharged patient.\n",
    "2. Support early intervention by medical staff for high-risk cases.\n",
    "3. Reduce overall hospital readmission rates and improve patient care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "- **Hospital Administrators** – for cost and resource optimization.\n",
    "- **Doctors and Nurses** – to prioritize high-risk patients.\n",
    "- **Patients and Caregivers** – to receive better follow-up care.\n",
    "- **Health Insurance Providers** – to reduce avoidable claims.\n"
